# Repository Infrastructure Management
#
# Update repository infrastructure on `push` or `workflow_dispatch` when the infrastructure config
# file (or this workflow) is updated. The user triggering the workflow run (`github.actor`) must be
# a repository admin.
#
# Note: The permissions of `github.actor` is checked because workflow re-runs will reuse the
# privileges of `github.actor` even if the actor initiating the re-run (`github.triggering_actor`)
# has different privileges.
